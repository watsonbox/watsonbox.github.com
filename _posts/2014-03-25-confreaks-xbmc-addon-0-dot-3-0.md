I finally got around to updating [xbmc-confreaks](https://github.com/watsonbox/xbmc-confreaks) to work properly with XBMC Frodo and Gotham. This time I've also submitted it to the official XBMC Addons repository so as of yesterday you should be able to install it through 'Get Addons' in XBMC itself. Be aware that you might need to refresh the repository (right click) first.
